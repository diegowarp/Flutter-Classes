# Flutter-Classes

In this repository, I intend register my evolution in Flutter learning while taking Flutter classes following this course: [Criação de Apps Android/iOS/Web com Flutter](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-completo-flutter-app-android-ios/). 

<h3>Application 0: Counter</h3>

This was the first application I developed with the course. The idea is to be used for counting people in a establishment or event (given the context of crowd limitation). Its goal, as a simple and basic starting point, is to introduce the fundamental structures of a Flutter application, such as the main widgets and project structures.

<h3>Application 1: Currency Converter</h3>

In this application, new subjects were introduced. Its functioning is done through the finance API from HG Finance (HG Brasil, free), which allows real-time conversion of different currencies. In the app, the selected currencies were the Brazilian real, US dollar, euro, and bitcoin. The learning in this development involved manipulating more widgets, performing functions to optimize the code, and making some HTTP requests.
